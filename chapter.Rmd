## Abstract

This chapter explores the validity of digital traces of interactions on social media as a measure of teachers' professional networks. It leverages a unique data set of both teachersâ€™ self-reports (n = 110 respondents) of their professional network, #NGSSchat for science educators, and digital traces of the interactions of teachers (n = ~20,000 tweets) in the same network. The comparison includes the size of the network, centrality measures, and alignment of self-reported interactions. This study offers insights into the use of digital data in studying teachers' social networks and provides practical implications for researchers studying teachers' digital networks.
